# LabWindows/CVI Test: 3D Printer control panel
This is a project for learning 
[LabWindows/CVI](https://www.ni.com/en-us/shop/electronic-test-instrumentation/programming-environments-for-electronic-test-and-instrumentation/what-is-labwindows-cvi.html),
by creating a simple control UI for a 3D printer.
The 3D printer should be running firmware compatible with 
[Marlin G-code commands](https://marlinfw.org/meta/gcode/).

Disclaimer: This project will probably get messy, because LabWindows projects were not designed to be friendly to git source control.
